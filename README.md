This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using Python's turtle module. The objective of the game is to control the snake using the arrow keys to eat the food that appears on the screen. Each time the snake eats food, it grows in length. The game ends if the snake collides with the boundaries of the screen or with its own body.
